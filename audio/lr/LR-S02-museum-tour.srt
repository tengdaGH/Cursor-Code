1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,172
Good morning and welcome to the Natural History Museum.

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:08,357
Today's tour will take about an hour and a half.

3
00:00:08,357 --> 00:00:13,302
We'll begin with the geology exhibit on the ground floor.

4
00:00:13,302 --> 00:00:18,176
This collection features rocks and minerals from around the world.

5
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:23,357
The crystal display in the center was donated by a local university.

6
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:27,561
Please do not touch any of the items behind the glass.

7
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:33,332
Photography is allowed, but flash photography is not permitted in this area.

8
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:38,752
Moving on, we'll visit the marine biology section on the second floor.

9
00:00:38,752 --> 00:00:44,408
You'll notice a full-size model of a blue whale hanging from the ceiling.

10
00:00:44,408 --> 00:00:50,672
This exhibit explains how ocean currents affect the migration patterns of sea creatures.

11
00:00:50,672 --> 00:00:56,587
Researchers have found that rising ocean temperatures are threatening coral reef ecosystems.

12
00:00:56,587 --> 00:01:02,909
The interactive displays allow visitors to explore deep-sea environments through virtual reality.

13
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:09,156
Next, we'll head to the dinosaur wing, which is our most popular attraction.

14
00:01:09,156 --> 00:01:15,355
The skeleton you see here belongs to a Tyrannosaurus rex discovered in Montana.

15
00:01:15,355 --> 00:01:22,255
Scientists believe this particular specimen lived approximately sixty-five million years ago.

16
00:01:22,255 --> 00:01:28,765
Recent studies suggest that some dinosaurs may have had feathers rather than scales.

17
00:01:28,765 --> 00:01:35,112
The fossil preparation lab is visible through the window at the end of this hallway.

18
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:42,476
Our paleontologists are currently working on a newly discovered species from South America.

19
00:01:42,476 --> 00:01:48,990
Before we move on, feel free to take a closer look at the exhibits and ask any questions.

20
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:56,388
The gift shop near the exit carries books, models, and educational kits related to everything you've seen today.
