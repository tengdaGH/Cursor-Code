Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Art History 201.

2
00:00:06,494 --> 00:00:12,224
Today we'll be looking at the evolution of painting techniques during the Italian Renaissance.

3
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:19,002
The Renaissance marked a dramatic shift from the flat, symbolic imagery of the medieval period.

4
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:26,634
Artists began to experiment with perspective, which allowed them to create a convincing illusion of depth on a flat surface.

5
00:00:26,634 --> 00:00:34,020
One of the earliest examples of linear perspective can be found in Masaccio's fresco, The Holy Trinity.

6
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:43,036
By using a single vanishing point, Masaccio was able to give the viewer the impression of looking into an actual architectural space.

7
00:00:43,036 --> 00:00:51,422
Another key development was the use of chiaroscuro, a technique that involves strong contrasts between light and dark.

8
00:00:51,422 --> 00:01:01,074
Leonardo da Vinci refined this approach in works like the Mona Lisa, where the soft gradation of tones creates a remarkably lifelike appearance.

9
00:01:01,074 --> 00:01:08,171
It's worth noting that Renaissance painters didn't simply abandon all earlier traditions overnight.

10
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:16,213
Many continued to work within the framework of religious commissions while gradually incorporating these new naturalistic techniques.

11
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:27,770
The patronage system played a crucial role in shaping artistic production, as wealthy families like the Medici commissioned works to demonstrate their power and cultural sophistication.

12
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:35,941
Raphael's School of Athens is often considered one of the finest examples of High Renaissance composition and spatial harmony.

13
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:47,483
What makes this painting particularly remarkable is the way Raphael arranged dozens of figures within a complex architectural setting without creating a sense of visual clutter.

14
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:57,042
The introduction of oil paint, which originated in Northern Europe, gave artists far greater control over color blending and surface texture.

15
00:01:57,042 --> 00:02:06,307
Unlike tempera, which dries very quickly, oil paint remains workable for much longer, allowing for subtle adjustments and layered effects.

16
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:16,437
Titian, one of the leading painters of the Venetian school, exploited this property of oil paint to achieve an extraordinary richness and warmth of color.

17
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:30,102
It's important to recognize that the technical innovations of the Renaissance did not emerge in isolation but were closely tied to broader intellectual movements, including humanism and the revival of classical learning.

18
00:02:30,102 --> 00:02:41,821
Scholars have argued that the growing emphasis on observation and empirical study in the sciences directly influenced how painters approached the representation of the natural world.

19
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:52,188
For next week's class, I'd like you to read the chapter on Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling and think about how it reflects the themes we discussed today.

20
00:02:52,188 --> 00:03:03,869
If anyone would like to explore this topic further, I've placed a list of recommended readings and museum resources on the course website, and I encourage you to take advantage of them before the midterm examination.
