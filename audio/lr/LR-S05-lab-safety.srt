00:00:01,005 --> 00:00:05,689
Good afternoon, and welcome to the biology lab.

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:11,332
Before we begin, I'd like to go over some important safety rules.

3
00:00:11,332 --> 00:00:16,137
Safety goggles must be worn at all times during experiments.

4
00:00:16,137 --> 00:00:20,217
Lab coats are available in the cabinet next to the door.

5
00:00:20,217 --> 00:00:24,575
Never eat or drink anything while you are working in the laboratory.

6
00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:29,406
All chemicals should be handled with gloves to avoid skin contact.

7
00:00:29,406 --> 00:00:34,727
The emergency eyewash station is located right behind the instructor's desk.

8
00:00:34,727 --> 00:00:40,264
If you accidentally spill any chemicals, notify your instructor immediately.

9
00:00:40,264 --> 00:00:45,299
Fire extinguishers are mounted on the wall near both exits of this room.

10
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:51,547
Make sure you know the location of the nearest emergency exit before starting your work.

11
00:00:51,547 --> 00:00:57,996
Used materials must be disposed of in the designated waste containers, not in the regular trash.

12
00:00:57,996 --> 00:01:04,785
Biological samples should always be stored in sealed containers and clearly labeled with your name.

13
00:01:04,785 --> 00:01:11,226
When using a microscope, make sure the lens is clean before placing your slide on the stage.

14
00:01:11,226 --> 00:01:17,148
Each group is responsible for cleaning their workstation at the end of every lab session.

15
00:01:17,148 --> 00:01:24,326
If the fire alarm goes off during an experiment, turn off all equipment and exit through the nearest door.

16
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:31,545
You are required to complete the online safety quiz before you will be allowed to participate in any lab activities.

17
00:01:31,545 --> 00:01:39,484
Proper ventilation is essential when working with volatile substances, so always use the fume hood provided.

18
00:01:39,484 --> 00:01:47,006
In the event of a chemical burn, immediately rinse the affected area with cold water for at least fifteen minutes.

19
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:55,088
All lab reports must follow the standard format outlined in the course syllabus and be submitted by the end of the week.

20
00:01:55,088 --> 00:02:03,087
If you have any questions about today's procedures or the equipment we'll be using, please raise your hand and I'll come over to help.
