## Existing Questions (Reference)

### D01 - Required Courses Outside Major (Practice)
**Category:** Education  
**Source:** Practice  
**Image:** None

**Professor Question:**
Do you think that universities should require all students to take at least one course in a subject outside their major (for example, a science student taking an arts course, or an arts student taking a science course)? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **Alex:** I think they should. In my major we never read anything from other fields, and I feel like I'm missing a lot. If I had to take one course in history or literature, I would see how other people think and solve problems. That could help me in my own work later.
- **Sam:** I'm not sure. Students already have a lot of required courses in their major. Adding one more requirement might mean they have less time for what they really want to study. Maybe it's better to just encourage students to take electives instead of requiring them.

### D02 - Group Work vs Individual Work (Practice)
**Category:** Education  
**Source:** Practice

**Professor Question:**
Some people believe that working in a group is the best way to learn, while others prefer to work alone. In your experience, which helps you learn more—group work or individual work? Use reasons or examples to support your view.

**Student Posts:**
- **Jordan:** I learn more in groups. When I work with others, I have to explain my ideas and listen to theirs. That makes me think more clearly. Also, if I don't understand something, someone in the group might explain it in a different way that makes sense to me.
- **Casey:** I prefer working alone. In groups, sometimes we spend too much time deciding what to do instead of actually doing it. When I work by myself, I can focus and go at my own pace. I also feel like I remember the material better when I've figured it out on my own.

### D03 - Reducing Car Use (Practice)
**Category:** Environment  
**Source:** Practice  
**Image:** None

**Professor Question:**
Many cities are trying to reduce the use of cars by adding bike lanes, improving public transport, or making it more expensive to park. Do you think that governments should encourage people to use cars less? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **Riley:** Yes. Cars cause a lot of pollution and traffic. If more people used buses or bikes, the air would be cleaner and it would be easier to get around. I think governments should make public transport cheaper and safer so that people choose it instead of driving.
- **Morgan:** It depends on the city. In some places, public transport doesn't go everywhere people need to go. If you have to get to work or take kids to school, a car might be the only option. So I think governments should improve alternatives first before making driving harder or more expensive.

### D04 - Financial Literacy in Schools (Practice)
**Category:** Education  
**Source:** Practice  
**Image:** None

**Professor Question:**
Some schools have started to teach students about managing money—for example, budgeting, saving, and avoiding debt. Should financial literacy be a required subject in high school? Use reasons or examples to support your answer.

**Student Posts:**
- **Taylor:** I think it should be required. A lot of young adults get into debt because they never learned how to manage money. If we learned about budgets and saving in school, we would be better prepared when we start working and living on our own.
- **Jamie:** It could be useful, but I'm not sure it needs to be required. Students already have many required subjects. Maybe it could be an optional course or a short workshop. Also, some of this might be better taught by parents or through real experience.

### D05 - Gap Year (Practice)
**Category:** Education  
**Source:** Practice  
**Image:** None

**Professor Question:**
In some countries, young people are encouraged to take a "gap year"—a year off between high school and university—to travel, work, or volunteer. Do you think taking a gap year is a good idea? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **Quinn:** I think it's a good idea. A year of travel or work can help you understand what you want to study and why. You might also learn skills that you don't get in school. When you start university, you could be more focused and motivated.
- **Avery:** I'm not sure. If you take a year off, you might forget some of what you learned in high school. It could also be harder to get back into the habit of studying. And not everyone can afford to travel or take a year without earning money. So it might work for some people but not for everyone.

### D06 - Books vs Videos (Practice)
**Category:** Education  
**Source:** Practice  
**Image:** None

**Professor Question:**
Some people think that reading books (fiction or non-fiction) is more valuable than watching videos or films on the same topics. Others think that videos and films can teach us just as much as books. What do you think? Use reasons or examples to support your view.

**Student Posts:**
- **Parker:** I think reading is more valuable for learning. When you read, you have to imagine the scenes and think about the words. That uses your brain more. With videos, everything is already shown to you, so you might not think as deeply. Reading also improves your vocabulary and writing.
- **Skyler:** Videos and films can be just as valuable. Documentaries can show you real places and events that are hard to describe in words. And a good film can make you feel and think about a topic in a powerful way. For some people, watching is easier than reading, so they might learn more from a video than from a book.

### D07 - Automation (Practice)
**Category:** Technology  
**Source:** Practice  
**Image:** `images/d07-automation.png`

**Professor Question:**
Some people think that automation and artificial intelligence have advantages, but there are disadvantages as well. What do you think? Is automation a positive or negative development?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think the use of automation is a positive development. If AI and robots are used instead of human workers, companies will be able to produce many more products than they do now. They can also lower costs, making those products cheaper for people to buy. As a result, everyone will have access to more-affordable products.
- **[Author2]:** I worry about the psychological effects on people as AI and robots take over work. I doubt humans will really be happy with ever-greater amounts of leisure time. Many of us derive satisfaction from working and doing our jobs well. In fact, never in human history have we been able to spend large parts of our days labor-free.

### D08 - Being An Early Adopter (Practice)
**Category:** Other  
**Source:** Practice  
**Image:** `images/d08-being-an-early-adopter.png`

**Professor Question:**
When new technologies come out, they're often quite expensive, but once they've been on the market for a while, the price usually drops. That's why I usually wait to buy new technology. Do you think it's better to be an early adopter of new technology or to wait until prices come down?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think being an early adopter is worth it. You get to use the latest features and improvements first, which can make your work or life more efficient. Even though you pay more, you benefit from the technology longer.
- **[Author2]:** I prefer to wait. Early adopters often pay a premium for technology that might have bugs or issues. By waiting, you get a more stable product at a lower price, and you can learn from others' experiences.

### D09 - Benefits of Switching Jobs Often (Practice)
**Category:** Economy  
**Source:** Practice  
**Image:** `images/d09-benefits-of-switching-jobs-often.png`

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on human resource management. Some people believe that switching jobs frequently has benefits, while others think it has disadvantages. Do you think the benefits of switching jobs often outweigh the disadvantages? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** 
I believe that it can be beneficial for people to change jobs often. If you do the same job for a long time, for example, several years, you might become too comfortable with the job. This could mean the job is no longer challenging for you and it could cause you to be bored and unsatisfied at work.
- **[Author2]:** I think staying in one job longer is better. When you switch jobs frequently, employers might see you as unreliable or not committed. Also, you miss out on opportunities for promotion and building deeper relationships with colleagues.

### D10 - Businesspeople Should Learn Sales Techniques Or Management Skills？ (Practice)
**Category:** Education  
**Source:** Practice  
**Image:** `images/d10-businesspeople-should-learn-sales-techni.png`

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on business. Should businesspeople learn sales techniques or management skills? Which do you think is more important and why?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think that management skills are most important. Sales tasks are something that a businessperson can delegate to a team of salespeople once the business gets going, so it is really important that the future businessperson develops skills to manage teams of people. Without that, it is not very likely the business will grow.
- **[Author2]:** I think sales skills are more important, especially when starting a business. You need to be able to sell your product or service to get customers. Management can come later once you have a team to manage.

### D11 - Buy Goods Made in Their Own Country (Practice)
**Category:** Other  
**Source:** Practice

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on economics. Some people believe that consumers should buy goods made in their own country to support local businesses and the economy, while others think it's better to buy products from wherever they can get the best quality or price. Do you think people should prioritize buying goods made in their own country? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think people should buy goods made in their own country. This supports local businesses and helps create jobs in our economy. When we buy local products, the money stays in our country and benefits our community. It also helps reduce our dependence on foreign products.
- **[Author2]:** I don't think people should be required to buy only domestic products. Consumers should be free to choose based on quality, price, and personal preference. International trade benefits everyone by providing access to better products and lower prices. Protectionism can lead to higher costs and less innovation.

### D14 - Career or Relationships Imapcting Happiness (Practice)

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on psychology. Some people believe that career has a greater impact on overall happiness, while others think relationships are more important. Which do you think has a greater impact on their overall happiness and why?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I believe that one's career has a larger impact on overall happiness. It's through people's jobs that they make a contribution to society and are recognized for their contributions. Through people's jobs, they can make a contribution to something greater than themselves, which can be very fulfilling. A sense of satisfaction can come from a job well done.
- **[Author2]:** Work is not all that matters. If you're someone who works full-time, that's still only half of your working life. To maximize happiness, it's vital to maintain connections with people you care about and who care about you. For example, there's nothing that lifts spirits like being able to talk to a friend when I'm down.

### D15 - Celebrities or Ordinary People Taking about Products as Advertising Strategies (Practice)

**Professor Question:**
viewers first notice the celebrity. “What's this? | really like that

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think using celebrities is more effective. Celebrities have large followings and can influence people's purchasing decisions. When people see their favorite celebrity using a product, they want to use it too. This creates a strong connection between the product and positive associations.
- **[Author2]:** I like the "ordinary people" approach. People are more interested in a product when they see people like themselves using the product. I think this is even true for clothing advertisements, which traditionally use famous models. Ordinary people make products seem more accessible and relatable.

### D16 - Children's Caring for Pets (Practice)

**Source:** Practice  
**Image:** `images/d16-children's-caring-for-pets.png`

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on child development. Some people believe that children benefit from caring for a pet animal. What do you think are the important benefits from caring for a pet animal? Why?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I can think of one clear benefit. When you read interviews with famous scientists, especially biologists, you learn that their interest in science was often awakened because they had a pet animal or animals as children. Playing with the animals and observing them led those people to develop an interest in natural science.
- **[Author2]:** I think caring for pets teaches children responsibility and empathy. Children learn to take care of another living being, which helps them develop compassion and understanding. This can also help children learn about life cycles and the natural world.

### D17 - Cities Try to Save Historic Buildings (Practice)
**Category:** Other  
**Source:** Practice  
**Image:** `images/d17-cities-try-to-save-historic-buildings.png`

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on urban planning. Some cities try to save historic buildings, while others replace them with modern buildings made of glass and steel that look like buildings in every other city. Do you think cities should preserve historic buildings or replace them with modern ones? Why?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think the preservation of old historic buildings involves a lot of problems, especially in densely populated cities. In modern cities, land is very valuable, and old buildings just do not provide as much living and working space as modern high-rise buildings. Also, they were not built to modern standards, so they may waste energy through inefficient heating and cooling.
- **[Author2]:** I believe historic buildings should be preserved. They give cities character and a sense of history. These buildings are part of our cultural heritage and tell the story of our past. Modern buildings can be built elsewhere, but historic buildings cannot be replaced once they're gone.

### D18 - Continual Risks as Business Strategy (Practice)
**Category:** Economy  
**Source:** Practice  
**Image:** `images/d18-continual-risks-as-business-strategy.png`

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on entrepreneurship. Some businesspeople believe that taking continual risks is necessary for business success, even if it means making mistakes that could affect a company negatively. Do you agree with this strategy? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think this strategy can easily backfire on a businessperson. I've seen companies conduct endless cycles of product enhancements in an effort to capture some other market share. But in reality, they just damage their own brand by sacrificing too much of the original content that made the product popular in the first place.
- **[Author2]:** I believe calculated risks are necessary for business growth. Companies that never take risks become stagnant and lose their competitive edge. However, risks should be well-researched and not reckless. The key is finding a balance between innovation and stability.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on education and career development. Some people believe that schools should focus more on teaching nonacademic skills like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, rather than just academic subjects. They argue that these soft skills are essential for success in the workplace and in life. Do you agree that schools should place more emphasis on developing these skills? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I agree that schools should focus more on soft skills. These skills are crucial for success in any career. Employers value employees who can communicate effectively, work in teams, and solve problems creatively. Academic knowledge alone isn't enough without these practical skills.
- **[Author2]:** I think academic skills should remain the priority. Soft skills can be developed through extracurricular activities and work experience, but academic knowledge provides the foundation for learning. Students need strong reading, writing, and math skills before they can effectively apply soft skills.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on environmental science. Some people argue that governments should impose an environmental tax on air travel to reduce pollution and encourage alternative forms of transportation. Do you think governments should impose an environmental tax on air travel? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** We should impose environmental taxes on air travel. These taxes might encourage people to find cheaper, more eco-friendly ways to get places. In my country, many people use planes to fly a short distance because flights are relatively cheap, when they could just as easily take a less polluting form of transportation.
- **[Author2]:** I don't think environmental taxes on air travel are fair. They would make travel more expensive for everyone, including people who need to travel for work or family reasons. Instead, governments should invest in developing cleaner aviation technology.

Your professor is teaching a class on political science. Some people argue that governments should provide financial support to artists and the arts. Do you believe that governments should provide financial support to artists? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I enjoy art as much as anyone does, but public funds come from taxes, and I don't think taxpayers' hard-earned money should be spent on impractical or inessential items and services. Artists should support themselves by selling their work to private individuals and companies. If they can't find enough buyers, then maybe they should change careers.
- **[Author2]:** I believe governments should support the arts. Art enriches our culture and provides educational value to society. Many artists struggle financially, and government support allows them to create works that benefit everyone, not just those who can afford to buy art.

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think flexible schedules are a great idea. They allow employees to balance work with personal responsibilities, which reduces stress and increases job satisfaction. This can lead to higher productivity and lower employee turnover.
- **[Author2]:** Flexible schedules can be problematic. It's harder for teams to collaborate when people work at different times. Also, some employees might take advantage of the flexibility, leading to inconsistent work quality and missed deadlines.

**Professor Question:**
What is your view? Do you think governments should keep fuel prices low? When the price of gasoline goes up, it costs people more to get to work. People don't have a choice about whether to go to work or not, so they should be protected from price increases.

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I agree that governments should keep fuel prices low. Many people rely on their cars to get to work, and sudden price increases can cause financial hardship. Stable fuel prices help families budget and plan their expenses.
- **[Author2]:** I think higher fuel prices can actually be beneficial. They encourage people to use public transportation or carpool, which reduces traffic and pollution. The money from higher fuel taxes can also be used to improve public transportation systems.

Your professor is teaching a class on public policy. Some people believe that governments should regulate social media platforms, while others think the companies themselves should regulate their platforms. Who do you think should regulate social media platforms—governments or the companies themselves? Why do you think so?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I believe social media companies should regulate themselves. They understand their platforms best and can respond quickly to issues. Government regulation might be too slow and could stifle innovation. Companies have a financial incentive to keep their platforms safe and user-friendly.
- **[Author2]:** I think governments should regulate social media platforms. Companies are motivated by profit and may not prioritize user safety or privacy. Government regulation ensures consistent standards and protects users from harmful content and data misuse.

### D34 - Governments Should Not Keep Scientific Discoveries Secret (Practice)

**Image:** `images/d34-governments-should-not-keep-scientific-d.png`

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on public policy. Some people argue that governments and companies should share all scientific discoveries publicly, while others believe they have the right to keep some discoveries secret. What do you believe and why?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I don't think all discoveries should be shared. Businesses, for example, often spend a lot of money on scientific research in order to make a discovery that can lead to profit. Even if that discovery benefits everyone, the business has a right to keep the discovery secret so that it can develop a profitable product from the research.
- **[Author2]:** I believe important scientific discoveries should be shared, especially those that could benefit public health or the environment. When discoveries are kept secret for profit, society misses out on potential benefits. However, I understand that companies need to protect their investments.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on business. When hiring employees, should companies prioritize experienced workers or younger employees fresh out of university? Why do you think so?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think a company should staff a business with the most experienced employees possible. If you're starting a new business, you need people around you who know what they are doing and can get the business up to speed fast. Spending time training inexperienced people will slow you down.
- **[Author2]:** I believe younger employees fresh out of university bring new ideas and energy to a company. They're often more adaptable to new technologies and can be trained to fit the company's specific needs. Also, they typically cost less than experienced workers.

**Image:** `images/d36-how-much-can-individuals-solve-water-pol.png`

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on environmental science. Some people believe that individual efforts can solve water pollution, while others think large institutions like corporations and governments need to take action. Who do you think can have a greater impact on solving water pollution—individuals or large institutions like corporations and governments? Please explain your position.

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** Individual efforts will likely have little effect. It is better to focus on large corporations that do the most damage to our waterways. Think of the oil companies that have spills and factory owners that dump chemicals into the waterways. These large-scale polluters need to be regulated and held accountable.
- **[Author2]:** Both are important, but large institutions have much more impact. Individuals pollute the water too, but companies have much more impact. Business leaders need to set examples for the community. However, individual actions can create pressure for change and demonstrate commitment to environmental protection.

### D38 - Imposing Taxes and Fines to Stop Companies from Harming the Environment (Practice)
**Category:** Environment  
**Source:** Practice  
**Image:** `images/d38-imposing-taxes-and-fines-to-stop-compani.png`

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on environmental science. Some people argue that governments should impose taxes and fines on companies that harm the environment. Do you think imposing taxes and fines is an effective way to stop companies from harming the environment? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I don't think it will be effective. Where I live, the local government imposes fines on polluting companies, but it doesn't stop them. I know of one business that created a lot of water pollution. Instead of changing their ways, they just paid a fine. No one was really punished, and the pollution is still a problem.
- **[Author2]:** I believe taxes and fines can be effective if they're high enough and consistently enforced. When companies face significant financial penalties, they're more likely to invest in cleaner technologies and practices. The key is making sure the penalties are substantial enough to outweigh the cost of polluting.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on education policy. Some people believe that increasing schoolteachers' pay would increase the quality of education. If they made more money, people would consider teaching as a profession instead of going into private industry. Others argue that schools should invest in additional resources like technology and materials instead. Which do you think is more important: improving teachers' salaries or providing additional resources? Why?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I believe that increasing schoolteachers' pay would increase the quality of education. If they made more money, people would consider teaching as a profession instead of going into private industry. Higher salaries would attract more qualified candidates and help retain experienced teachers.
- **[Author2]:** I think additional resources are more important. Even the best teachers can't be effective without proper materials, technology, and classroom resources. Students need up-to-date textbooks, computers, and other tools to learn effectively. Resources directly impact the learning environment.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on human resource management. Some companies are implementing job-sharing arrangements, where two or more people share the responsibilities of one full-time position. Do you think this arrangement is a positive trend? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I'm not sure job sharing is a good idea. I think it would be too confusing for employers to keep track of who is working on which day or who is responsible for certain projects. Employees might also get confused about which person to address their questions to. Communication could become complicated.
- **[Author2]:** I think job sharing is a positive trend. It allows people to balance work with personal responsibilities, which increases job satisfaction. It also brings diverse perspectives to a single role and can lead to better problem-solving. Companies benefit from having more flexible staffing options.

### D42 - Lecturing Is An Effective Teaching Method？ (Practice)
**Category:** Other  
**Source:** Practice

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on education. Some people believe that lecturing is an outdated teaching method that doesn't engage students effectively, while others argue that lectures are an efficient way to convey information to large groups of students. Do you think lecturing is an effective teaching method? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think lecturing can be effective when done well. A good lecturer can explain complex concepts clearly and efficiently. Lectures allow teachers to cover a lot of material in a short time and provide a structured learning experience. However, lectures should be combined with interactive activities to keep students engaged.
- **[Author2]:** I don't think lecturing is very effective. Students often lose focus during long lectures and don't retain information well. Interactive teaching methods like discussions, group work, and hands-on activities are more engaging and help students learn better. Students need to actively participate to truly understand the material.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on education. Some educators argue that schools should limit the teaching of fictional texts and focus more on nonfiction and practical reading materials that prepare students for real-world situations. Others believe that fiction is essential for developing imagination, empathy, and critical thinking skills. What do you think about this approach to education? Should schools limit the teaching of fictional texts? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think schools should limit fictional texts. Students need to learn practical reading skills for real-world situations like reading instructions, news articles, and professional documents. Nonfiction texts prepare students better for college and careers. Fiction is less useful for practical life skills.
- **[Author2]:** I believe fiction is essential for education. Fictional texts develop creativity, empathy, and critical thinking skills that nonfiction can't provide. Reading fiction helps students understand different perspectives and cultures. It also makes reading more enjoyable, which encourages students to read more.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on sociology. Some people spend their entire lives living in one town or city, while others move frequently to different places. Do you think it's better to live in one town or city all your life, or to move to different places? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think staying in one place is better. You develop deep roots and strong relationships with your community. You know the area well and feel a sense of belonging. Moving frequently can be stressful and make it hard to build lasting friendships and connections.
- **[Author2]:** I believe moving to different places is more beneficial. It exposes you to different cultures, perspectives, and opportunities. Living in multiple places helps you adapt to change and become more open-minded. You gain valuable life experiences and learn to be independent.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on economics. When local or regional governments need to reduce spending due to budget cuts, they must decide which areas to cut. What area of spending do you think local or regional governments should prioritize reducing when budget cuts are necessary? Why?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** My city has a lot of parks that require a lot of upkeep. If there's a need to reduce expenses, the city could make changes to the parks that make them less expensive to maintain. For example, grass lawns, which need to be cut weekly, could be replaced with other plant species that do not need to be cut frequently.
- **[Author2]:** I think governments should reduce spending on non-essential services rather than cutting important areas like education or public safety. Administrative costs and redundant programs could be streamlined first. Essential services that directly impact citizens' well-being should be protected.

### D48 - Making Purchasing Decisions (Practice)

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on marketing and consumer behavior. Many people now make purchasing decisions based on information from online sources like reviews, social media, and comparison websites. Some people rely heavily on online reviews, while others prefer to see products in person before buying. Do you think it's better to make purchasing decisions depending on information from online sources? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think online sources are very helpful for making purchasing decisions. Online reviews provide honest feedback from real customers who have used the products. Comparison websites help you find the best prices and features. Online information saves time and helps you make informed choices.
- **[Author2]:** I prefer to see products in person before buying. Online information can be misleading or fake. Reviews might be biased or paid for by companies. You can't truly evaluate quality, size, or how something feels without seeing it yourself. In-person shopping gives you a better sense of what you're buying.

### D49 - Motivating Young Students：Activities, Or Playtime (Practice)

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on education. Some teachers believe that making learning fun is a way to get students interested in learning. If they're having fun, they may grow to value learning in and of itself. My fourth-grade teacher made history come alive, and I've been an avid history buff ever since. If children are shown that learning itself is worthwhile, they're more likely to become lifelong learners. What do you think teachers should emphasize in their classrooms to motivate young students? Why?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think teachers should emphasize making learning fun and engaging. When students enjoy what they're learning, they're more motivated to participate and remember the material. Fun activities can help students develop a positive attitude toward learning that lasts throughout their lives.
- **[Author2]:** I believe teachers should focus on structured learning activities rather than just playtime. While fun is important, students need to develop discipline and study skills. A balance of engaging activities and serious academic work prepares students better for future challenges.

Your professor is teaching a class on education. Some people prefer online classes because they offer flexibility and convenience, while others prefer traditional in-person classes because they provide more interaction and structure. Which do you think is preferable to traditional in-person classes? Why?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I prefer traditional in-person classes. The face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates helps me learn better. I can ask questions immediately and get instant feedback. Also, being in a classroom helps me stay focused and motivated.
- **[Author2]:** I think online classes are more convenient and flexible. I can learn at my own pace and review materials as many times as I need. Online classes also save time and money on commuting. However, they require more self-discipline to stay on track.

### D52 - Online Shopping Is Affecting Society？ (Practice)

**Professor Question:**
More and more, online shopping is becoming the primary way that many people obtain everyday goods. But what are the ramifications for the society in which we live? On the one hand, online shopping has advantages—for example, you can make a purchase without ever leaving home. However, with fewer people shopping at local shops, in some places, these establishments are having a hard time competing. Do you think that online shopping is, on the whole, affecting society?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think online shopping is having a negative impact on local communities. Small businesses are closing because they can't compete with online retailers. This reduces the sense of community and eliminates local jobs. We're losing the personal connections that come from shopping locally.
- **[Author2]:** I think online shopping is actually beneficial for society. It saves people time and often offers better prices. It also creates new jobs in logistics and technology. Local businesses can adapt by offering unique products and better customer service that online retailers can't match.

**Professor Question:**

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** Of course, children should participate in team sports! Not everyone is a great student. For many children, team sports are a chance to excel and build their confidence. They can recognize the importance of working hard to accomplish a goal, and this can transfer to other aspects of their lives.
- **[Author2]:** I think team sports can be beneficial, but they're not essential. Some children prefer individual activities like music or art, which can also teach discipline and perseverance. The key is finding activities that match each child's interests and abilities.

Your professor is teaching a class on health and nutrition. If people could start with one change to improve their eating habits, what would be the most important eating habit for most people to change, and why?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think the most important change would be to eat a better breakfast. Most people are so rushed in the morning that they don't take the time to sit down and eat a balanced meal. A good breakfast gives you more energy all day and keeps you from eating too much later.
- **[Author2]:** I believe reducing processed foods and sugary drinks would have the biggest impact. These foods are high in calories but low in nutrition. Replacing them with whole foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains would improve health significantly.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on education. Some people pursue an advanced degree while working full-time. Do you think it's better to pursue an advanced degree while working full-time? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think it's better to stop working and become a full-time student. It's challenging to combine a full-time job and studies, and one may easily fall behind. Focus on one thing at a time and do it well rather than try to do both and do neither very well. Overextending yourself can lead to disappointment.
- **[Author2]:** I believe working while studying can be beneficial. It provides practical experience that complements academic learning. Also, maintaining an income reduces financial stress and allows you to apply what you learn immediately in your job.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on education. Some opt to enroll full-time to complete an advanced degree as quickly as possible. Others choose to work while slowly progressing towards a degree. Given these options, I'm curious to know your thoughts. After finishing your undergraduate studies, do you prefer pursuing an advanced degree full-time or continuing work while studying part-time?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think it's better to go to college full-time instead of trying to balance part-time classes and a full-time job. For me, I know I wouldn't be able to focus on my studies if I was exhausted from work all the time. Full-time college allows me to put all my energy into my classes and get the most out of my education.
- **[Author2]:** I prefer working while studying part-time. It allows me to gain practical experience and apply what I learn in class to real-world situations. Also, working helps me pay for my education and reduces the financial burden.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on economics. Some people argue that governments should raise the cost of fuel for cars to encourage people to use public transportation or bicycles. Do you agree or disagree with this viewpoint? Why?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think it would be a good idea to raise fuel prices. Making it more expensive to drive cars would cause many people to choose public transportation or use bicycles instead. In my city, they've just added bicycle lanes to all of the major roads. So, it would be easy to give up driving.
- **[Author2]:** I disagree. Raising fuel prices would unfairly burden people who have no choice but to drive, such as those living in rural areas with limited public transportation. Instead, governments should invest in better public transportation systems first.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on education. I support requiring all first-year students to attend a course on good study habits. Even basic skills such as how to take good notes are very important for succeeding in university studies. Do you agree that universities should require first-year students to take a course on study habits? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I agree. Many students come to university without knowing how to study effectively. A required course on study habits would help them succeed academically and reduce stress. Learning these skills early can make a huge difference in their university experience.
- **[Author2]:** I think it should be optional, not required. Students have different learning styles, and a one-size-fits-all course might not be helpful for everyone. Those who need help can seek it out through tutoring or workshops.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on educational philosophy. What should children be learning in school? Many people argue that school curriculum must include classes in art and music. Do you agree? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I agree that traditional subjects like math, science, and reading are important, but so are classes in art and music. Engaging in creative activities stimulates their imaginations. That in turn facilitates critical thinking, which is essential in any curriculum, so I am in favor of including art and music in the school day.
- **[Author2]:** While art and music are valuable, I think schools should focus more on core academic subjects. With limited time and resources, schools need to prioritize reading, math, and science. Art and music can be pursued outside of school or as electives.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on child development. Some people believe that children should not have mobile phones before they reach a certain age, let's say ten years or so. I believe children younger than ten are not yet ready to deal with the world that comes with mobile phones, as it can put them at risk. Do you think there should be a minimum age for children to have mobile phones? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I agree that there should be a minimum age. Young children aren't mature enough to handle the responsibilities and risks that come with mobile phones, including online safety issues and screen time addiction. Parents should wait until children are older and more responsible.
- **[Author2]:** I think it depends on the child and the situation. Some children need phones for safety reasons, like contacting parents after school. Instead of banning phones, parents should teach children how to use them responsibly and monitor their usage.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on education. Some people argue that completing several shorter certification programs is more valuable than earning a university degree. Do you agree or disagree with this viewpoint? Why?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I agree that completing short certification programs makes a lot of sense these days because people are more likely to change careers now than they were in the past. Certification programs allow people to quickly learn a variety of professional skills that are in demand at the moment. And acquiring such skills leads to more job opportunities.
- **[Author2]:** I disagree. A university degree provides a broader education and develops critical thinking skills that are valuable in any career. While certifications are useful for specific skills, a degree offers more long-term value and flexibility.

Shopping locally also supports the community and helps small business owners. The shopping experience is more pleasant and less overwhelming than large stores.
- **[Author2]:** I prefer superstores because they offer better prices and more variety. I can find everything I need in one place, which saves time. Superstores also have better return policies and more convenient hours. For busy people, superstores are more practical.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a sociology class. Social media influencers have become very popular, with millions of followers. Some people think influencers have a positive impact on society, while others think their influence is negative. What do you think about the impact of social media influencers on their followers? Why do you think so?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think the influencers' effect is generally positive. People can learn about the latest trends and topics in a very quick and efficient way by following influencers. In the past, people had to spend time looking through magazines or visiting boutiques to even know what was trending. Influencers make information more accessible.
- **[Author2]:** I think influencers can have a negative impact. They often promote unrealistic lifestyles and products, which can make people feel inadequate or spend money they don't have. Some influencers also spread misinformation. People should be more critical of what they see online.

### D66 - Spend More Money on Art+Music Museums, Or Playgrounds and Public Swimming Pools (Practice)
**Category:** Economy  
**Source:** Practice  
**Image:** `images/d66-spend-more-money-on-art+music-museums,-o.png`

**Professor Question:**
Today, we're going to discuss whether or not the government should spend more money on supporting the arts, such as art and music museums, than on public facilities like playgrounds and public swimming pools. On one hand, investing in the arts can have many benefits for society, such as promoting creativity, cultural awareness, and preserving history. On the other hand, there are concerns about the high cost of supporting the arts, and the argument that funding should be directed towards more practical and tangible improvements for the community, such as improving public facilities and infrastructure. What do you think? Should the government spend more money on art and music museums than on facilities like playgrounds and public swimming pools? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think the government should prioritize public facilities like playgrounds and swimming pools. These facilities provide direct benefits to families and children, promoting physical health and community engagement. While arts are important, they can be supported through private funding and donations.
- **[Author2]:** I believe investing in arts and music museums is crucial for cultural preservation and education. These institutions inspire creativity and provide educational opportunities that benefit society in the long term. Public facilities are important, but arts funding should not be neglected.

### D67 - Spending Time with A Close-knit Few Or A Larger Group of Friends (Practice)
**Category:** Society  
**Source:** Practice  
**Image:** `images/d67-spending-time-with-a-close-knit-few-or-a.png`

**Professor Question:**
Let's explore the dynamics of social interactions and their impact on our well-being. Socializing in smaller groups versus larger circles can have varying effects on one's health and happiness. Some argue that smaller groups foster deeper connections, allowing for more meaningful interactions and a sense of closeness. Conversely, larger friend circles offer diversity and exposure to different perspectives. Which do you think contributes more to a person's health and happiness: spending time with a close-knit few or a larger group of friends?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think strong bonds with a few close friends fosters deeper connections and enhances emotional support. These intimate relationships often lead to increased trust and understanding, allowing for genuine empathy and shared experiences. Small friend groups offer a sense of security and authenticity in interactions, promoting mental well-being.
- **[Author2]:** I prefer having a larger group of friends. It exposes me to diverse perspectives and experiences, which helps me grow as a person. A larger network also provides more opportunities for social activities and support when needed.

### D68 - Students Exploring Nature and Learning about Environment (Practice)
**Category:** Education

**Image:** `images/d68-students-exploring-nature-and-learning-a.png`

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on education. Some schools have programs where students spend time exploring nature and learning about the environment. Do you think this is a good idea? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think it's an excellent idea. Students learn better when they experience things firsthand. Exploring nature helps students understand environmental issues and develop a connection with the natural world. This kind of hands-on learning is more memorable than reading about it in textbooks.
- **[Author2]:** While nature exploration is valuable, I think schools should focus more on core academic subjects. There's limited time in the school day, and students need to master reading, math, and science first. Nature programs can be offered as optional after-school activities.

### D69 - Students Should Be Allowed to Choose Their Own Field of Study (Practice)
**Category:** Education  
**Source:** Practice  
**Image:** `images/d69-students-should-be-allowed-to-choose-the.png`

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on education policy. Some people believe that students should be allowed to choose their own field of study, while others think it's a mistake to let students at that age make such an important decision on their own. They usually don't have the wisdom to choose appropriately. The people who know them best—parents and teachers—should help guide this decision. What do you think? Should students be allowed to choose their own field of study? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think students should be allowed to choose. When students pick their own field, they're more motivated to learn and succeed. They know their own interests and passions better than anyone else. Making this choice also teaches them responsibility and independence.
- **[Author2]:** I think students need guidance from parents and teachers. Young people often don't have enough information about different career paths or what they're really good at. Adults who know them well can help them make better decisions that align with their strengths and future opportunities.

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think books have a greater impact. Reading requires active engagement and imagination, which develops critical thinking skills. Books also provide deeper analysis and more detailed information than TV programs. The act of reading itself improves vocabulary and writing skills.
- **[Author2]:** Unlike books, TV makes information readily available to everyone. Its audio-visual nature appeals to a broad audience, reaching people of all literacy levels. TV can bring current events and educational content to millions of people instantly, making it more accessible than books.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on communications. Some people suggest taking breaks from reading or watching news for a period of a few days or weeks to reduce stress and anxiety. Do you think it's a good idea to take breaks from news for a period of a few days or weeks? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think taking breaks from news can be beneficial. Constant exposure to negative news can cause stress and anxiety. A break allows people to focus on their daily lives and mental health. However, it's important to stay informed about important events.
- **[Author2]:** Whether it's a good idea or not, it would be impossible. Today, we're exposed to the news everywhere—on our phones, on our computers, on big TV screens in waiting rooms and in airport lounges. To take a break from the news, you would have to withdraw from all activities in society, which is unrealistic.

Your professor is teaching a class on social psychology. Some people believe that volunteering is the best way to make new friends. For example, when my city's Beautification Committee asked for volunteers to plant flowers around the downtown square, to make it more appealing for residents and visitors, I joined a dozen others in this project. We worked together and got to know each other. What do you think is the best way to make new friends? Why?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think volunteering is a great way to make friends. When you volunteer, you meet people who share your values and interests. Working together on a common goal creates strong bonds. Volunteering also provides natural opportunities for conversation and connection.
- **[Author2]:** I think joining clubs or groups based on hobbies is better. Whether it's a sports team, book club, or art class, shared interests create immediate connections. These activities are ongoing, so you have regular opportunities to build friendships over time.

**Category:** Economy  
**Source:** Practice  
**Image:** `images/d74-the-biggest-disadvantage-of-starting-one.png`

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on entrepreneurship. Starting a business often requires a significant sacrifice of time. There is so much that goes into establishing a company or setting up a shop. And even when the business is operational, the work for the owner never ends. Business owners are constantly worried about growing the business and seeking out opportunities. What do you think is the biggest disadvantage of starting one's own business? Why?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think the biggest disadvantage is the financial risk. Starting a business requires significant investment, and there's no guarantee of success. Many businesses fail, leaving owners with debt and lost savings. The financial stress can be overwhelming and affect personal relationships.
- **[Author2]:** I believe the biggest disadvantage is the time commitment. Business owners work long hours, often sacrificing personal time and family relationships. There's no work-life balance when you're responsible for everything. The constant pressure and stress can lead to burnout.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on environmental science. Many people want to help protect the environment but aren't sure what actions have the greatest impact. What do you think is the most important action one person can take for protecting the environment? Why?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** It might be better to pay more attention when we are shopping and to avoid purchasing items that aren't environmentally friendly, such as single-use plastic items. This would save time and energy because we will not have to recycle anything, and it might even leave us with more money. Reducing consumption is more effective than recycling.
- **[Author2]:** I think reducing energy consumption at home has the greatest impact. Using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights, and reducing heating and cooling can significantly lower one's carbon footprint. Transportation choices, like walking or biking instead of driving, also make a big difference.

Your professor is teaching a class on public policy. Food can be costly, especially for families who have many other expenses. I think my country's leaders should improve agricultural capacities so our people and our country as a whole can be more self-sufficient. What do you think is the most important action for leaders to take to improve their country's prosperity? Why?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think leaders should invest in education. A well-educated population drives innovation and economic growth. Education provides people with skills needed for better jobs and higher incomes. Countries with strong education systems tend to be more prosperous and competitive globally.
- **[Author2]:** I believe improving infrastructure is most important. Good transportation, communication networks, and energy systems attract businesses and enable trade. Infrastructure improvements create jobs and make the country more attractive to foreign investment, which boosts prosperity.

**Professor Question:**
In today's post, I would like you to discuss which criteria for promotion you see as the most important and explain why.

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I disagree with Andrew because I think years of work experience or seniority within the company should be the most important criteria. Companies that value loyalty tend to keep employees longer, which reduces turnover.
- **[Author2]:** I think companies have different policies and tend to value different things. Criteria for promotion should include employee performance and achievements in their current roles, not just seniority or years of experience.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on human resource management. I don't think businesses should allow their employees to work from home, because creating a sense of community and camaraderie among employees is so important for the success of a business. What do you think is the most important factor for an employer to consider when deciding where employees should work? Why?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think productivity is the most important factor. Employers should consider which work arrangement allows employees to be most productive. Some people work better in an office with structure and collaboration, while others are more productive working from home with fewer distractions.
- **[Author2]:** I believe employee satisfaction and work-life balance are most important. Happy employees are more loyal and productive. Allowing flexible work arrangements shows that employers value their employees' well-being, which can improve retention and attract top talent.

After all, they make up the majority of people who will be attending the university. What do you think is the most important thing a university should consider when making spending decisions? Why?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think universities should prioritize academic resources like libraries, laboratories, and technology. These directly impact the quality of education students receive. Good academic facilities attract better students and faculty, which improves the university's reputation and value.
- **[Author2]:** I believe student services and facilities are most important. Students need good housing, dining, health services, and recreational facilities to succeed. A comfortable and supportive campus environment helps students focus on their studies and improves their overall university experience.

- **[Author2]:** I believe a balanced diet is most important. What we eat directly affects our energy levels, weight, and risk of disease. A healthy diet provides essential nutrients that our bodies need to function properly. Good nutrition is the foundation of good health.

Your professor is teaching a class on study skills. I can't function without to-do lists. I outline what my plan is for the day. This provides the clear structure that I need to be productive. The best part of my day is when I check off my completed tasks. Do you think to-do lists are beneficial tools for learning and working? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think to-do lists are very beneficial. They help me organize my tasks and prioritize what's most important. Having a list reduces stress because I don't have to remember everything. Checking off completed tasks gives me a sense of accomplishment and motivation.
- **[Author2]:** I find to-do lists can be overwhelming. When I see a long list, I feel stressed and anxious. Sometimes I spend more time making lists than actually doing the work. I prefer to focus on one task at a time without the pressure of a list.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on child psychology. Some people believe that watching online videos is harmful to children, while others think educational videos can be beneficial. Do you think watching online videos is harmful to children? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think watching online videos is harmful to children. Children under two years old need to develop communication skills by interacting with other people. Passively watching videos exposes them to language, but it's not the same. Also, even for older children, sitting and staring at a device means they are not moving and exercising.
- **[Author2]:** I think educational videos can be beneficial when used appropriately. High-quality educational content can teach children new concepts and skills. The key is moderation and parental supervision. Videos should supplement, not replace, real-world interactions and physical activity.

Consider the following question: When people spend a lot of time watching sports or following their favorite team, does it have a negative effect on their lives? Why or why not?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think it can have a negative effect. Spending too much time watching sports takes away from other important activities like work, family time, or exercise. Some people also spend money they can't afford on tickets or merchandise. It can become an unhealthy obsession.
- **[Author2]:** I think being a sports fan can be positive. It provides entertainment and a sense of community with other fans. Following a team can teach people about teamwork, perseverance, and dealing with disappointment. As long as it's balanced with other responsibilities, it's a healthy hobby.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on public policy. Many governments want to attract more people to live in rural areas. Some suggest providing financial help to farmers. Although it may cost very little to live in a rural area, it costs a lot to begin a career in agriculture. If governments want to attract more people to rural areas, what approach do you think would be most effective? Why?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think governments should invest in infrastructure like high-speed internet and good transportation. Modern people need reliable internet for work and communication. Good roads and public transportation make rural areas more accessible and attractive to people who work in cities but want to live in the country.
- **[Author2]:** In my country, urban centers are great places to live because you can access shops, restaurants, and museums. If the government of my country wanted to attract me to live in a rural area, the area would first have to attract more businesses focused on entertainment and culture than most rural areas have now.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on business and human resources. I think one thing that makes a company attractive is location. When companies choose a location for a facility, they should think about whether it's a place that employees want to be. For example, locating a workplace in a big city where there are lots of shops and entertainment options could be a good way to attract new employees. What do you think companies can do to be attractive to potential employees? Why?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think offering competitive salaries and benefits is most important. Good pay and health insurance attract talented employees. Companies should also provide opportunities for professional development and career growth. These factors matter more than location for most people.
- **[Author2]:** I believe work-life balance and company culture are key. Flexible work schedules, remote work options, and a positive work environment make companies attractive. Employees want to feel valued and have time for their personal lives, not just work all the time.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on sociology. When people want to donate to charity, they can choose between local organizations or international ones. For example, with local charities like shelters for homeless animals, you can visit the shelter and see for yourself how donations are being used to confirm that your money is being well spent. You may even be encouraged to give more because you were able to witness the positive effects your contribution had on the organization. Which do you think is the better choice? Why?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I prefer local charities because I can see the direct impact of my donations. I can visit the organizations and verify that my money is being used effectively. Local charities also address issues in my own community, which I can relate to more personally.
- **[Author2]:** I think international charities can have a greater impact. They address global issues like poverty, disease, and natural disasters that affect millions of people. While I can't visit them personally, reputable international organizations have transparency reports and can reach more people in need.

**Professor Question:**
Your professor is teaching a class on education. Many high school students seem disinterested in learning. What strategy do you think teachers should use to increase high school students' interest in learning? Please explain why.

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I believe teachers should incorporate more group work activities into their lessons. While completing tasks in groups or teams, students will have an opportunity to share their opinions and learn from their peers. Having a sense of belonging is important to teenagers, so being part of a team will likely make them more interested in learning.
- **[Author2]:** I think teachers should connect lessons to real-world applications. When students see how what they're learning relates to their lives and future careers, they become more engaged. Using current events, technology, and hands-on projects makes learning more relevant and interesting.

### D07 - Automation (Practice)

**Image:** `images/d07-automation.png`

**Professor Question:**
Some people think that automation and artificial intelligence have advantages, but there are disadvantages as well. What do you think? Is automation a positive or negative development?

**Student Posts:**
- **[Author1]:** I think the use of automation is a positive development. If AI and robots are used instead of human workers, companies will be able to produce many more products than they do now. They can also lower costs, making those products cheaper for people to buy. As a result, everyone will have access to more-affordable products.
- **[Author2]:** I worry about the psychological effects on people as AI and robots take over work. I doubt humans will really be happy with ever-greater amounts of leisure time. Many of us derive satisfaction from working and doing our jobs well. In fact, never in human history have we been able to spend large parts of our days labor-free.
