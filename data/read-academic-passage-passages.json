          "topic": "Earth science",
          "content": "The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. Water changes state between liquid, vapour, and ice as it moves through the cycle.\n\nEvaporation from oceans, lakes, and rivers adds water vapour to the atmosphere. Plants also release water vapour through a process called transpiration. When the water vapour rises and cools, it condenses to form clouds. Precipitation—rain, snow, sleet, or hail—returns water to the surface. Some of this water runs off into streams and rivers, eventually reaching the ocean. Another portion seeps into the ground and becomes groundwater, which may later emerge in springs or be taken up by plant roots.\n\nThe cycle has no real beginning or end, but scientists often start by describing the ocean, which holds about 97 percent of Earth's water. Solar energy drives evaporation, and gravity pulls precipitation downward. Human activities, such as irrigation and the building of reservoirs, can alter local water distribution, but the global cycle as a whole remains balanced. Understanding the water cycle is essential for managing freshwater resources and predicting the effects of climate change on rainfall and drought.",

          "content": "Earth's outer layer, the lithosphere, is broken into several large plates that move slowly over the underlying asthenosphere. This movement is driven by heat from the planet's interior. Where plates meet, they may pull apart, collide, or slide past one another. These boundaries are the primary sites of earthquakes and volcanic activity.\n\nAt divergent boundaries, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, plates move apart and new crust forms from magma rising from below. At convergent boundaries, one plate may sink beneath another in a process called subduction, often forming deep ocean trenches and mountain ranges. Transform boundaries, where plates slide past each other, can produce large earthquakes when stress builds up and is suddenly released—as along the San Andreas Fault in California.\n\nScientists use the theory of plate tectonics to explain the distribution of volcanoes and earthquakes worldwide. Because plate boundaries are where the greatest stress accumulates, they are monitored closely for seismic hazard. Understanding plate motion also helps explain the long-term evolution of continents and ocean basins.",

In some cases, groups discuss ideas and reach a better solution because they combine different viewpoints. In other cases, groups make riskier or more cautious decisions than individuals would.\n\nOne well-known effect is called group polarisation. After a group discusses a topic, members often end up holding more extreme views than they did at the start. If most people initially lean in one direction, discussion tends to push them further in that direction. Another effect is groupthink, when the desire for agreement leads the group to ignore doubts or outside information. Groupthink can lead to poor decisions because criticism is suppressed.\n\nResearchers study these effects to understand how juries, committees, and organisations reach conclusions. Knowing about group polarisation and groupthink can help people design better meetings and encourage more careful decision-making.",

According to the theory, first developed by Leon Festinger in the 1950s, people are motivated to reduce this discomfort. They may do so by changing one of the beliefs, changing their behaviour, or adding new information that makes the conflict seem less important.\n\nFor example, a person who values health but smokes might minimise the health risks of smoking, quit smoking, or decide that the pleasure of smoking outweighs the risk. How people reduce dissonance depends on how committed they are to their beliefs and how easy it is to change their behaviour. In some cases, people may even deny or distort evidence to protect their self-image.\n\nDissonance theory has been used to study decisions about consumer behaviour, political attitudes, and moral behaviour. Critics have noted that the theory is broad and that people sometimes tolerate inconsistency without obvious discomfort. Nevertheless, the idea that people seek consistency between their attitudes and actions remains influential in social psychology.",

          "content": "The invention of the printing press in Europe in the mid-fifteenth century is often regarded as one of the most important developments in human history. Before the press, books were copied by hand, which was slow and expensive. Only a small number of people had access to written works.\n\nJohannes Gutenberg's press, which used movable type, made it possible to produce many copies of a text quickly and at lower cost. The first major book printed in this way was the Bible. Soon, printers across Europe were producing not only religious texts but also scientific works, political pamphlets, and literature. Ideas could spread much faster than before.\n\nScholars have argued that the printing press contributed to major social and intellectual movements. The Protestant Reformation, for example, relied on the wide distribution of Bibles and pamphlets so that people could read and interpret religious texts for themselves. Similarly, the scientific revolution was aided by the rapid exchange of research and ideas through printed books and letters. Literacy rates rose as more people had reason to learn to read.\n\nOf course, the press did not act alone. Political, economic, and religious conditions in Europe shaped how and where printing spread. Nevertheless, the technology made it possible for ideas to reach a far wider audience than ever before, with lasting effects on education, religion, and politics.",

Instead, they look for multiple factors—economic, political, cultural, and technological—that interact over time. The decline of a dynasty, the rise of industrialisation, or the spread of a new religion can seldom be attributed to one event or one person.\n\nFor instance, the fall of the Roman Empire in the West has been explained by military pressure at the borders, economic strain, political instability, and cultural shifts. No single factor is sufficient on its own; historians debate how to weigh each. Similarly, the Industrial Revolution in Britain depended on technological innovation, access to raw materials and capital, labour supply, and a legal and political environment that allowed investment and trade. Change in one area made change in others possible.\n\nThis approach does not mean that individual actions or events are unimportant. Rather, it means that they are understood within a broader context. Historians also distinguish between short-term triggers—a battle, a treaty, a discovery—and long-term causes that may have developed over decades or centuries.

Figures might be sized by importance rather than by their position in space. Renaissance artists studied geometry and optics to represent the world more as the eye sees it. Buildings, tiles, and roads could be drawn so that they appeared to recede into the distance.\n\nThe technique was used in religious and secular works alike.

          "content": "Impressionism, which emerged in France in the 1860s and 1870s, broke with the academic tradition that had dominated European painting. Instead of carefully finished surfaces and historical or mythological subjects, Impressionist painters often worked outdoors, capturing the effects of light and atmosphere at a particular moment. Brushwork became more visible; colour was often applied in separate strokes that blended in the viewer's eye.\n\nArtists such as Monet, Renoir, and Degas were initially rejected by the official Salon. They organised their own exhibitions and were criticised for their \"unfinished\" look and their choice of everyday subjects—street scenes, cafés, gardens. Critics argued that the works lacked the finish and moral seriousness of academic art. Over time, however, the movement gained acceptance and influenced later developments in modern art.\n\nThe emphasis on light, colour, and the perception of the moment also reflected broader changes in nineteenth-century culture, including the rise of photography and new theories of vision.

Demand refers to how much of a good or service consumers are willing and able to buy at different prices. Generally, when the price goes down, demand goes up. Supply refers to how much producers are willing and able to sell at different prices. Usually, when the price goes up, supply goes up, because higher prices give producers an incentive to produce more.\n\nThe point where supply and demand meet is called the equilibrium. At the equilibrium price, the quantity that producers want to sell equals the quantity that consumers want to buy. If the price is above equilibrium, there is a surplus: more is supplied than demanded. If the price is below equilibrium, there is a shortage: more is demanded than supplied. In both cases, market forces tend to push the price toward equilibrium.\n\nThis model is a simplification.

If a factory pollutes a river, the cost of the pollution may be borne by people who live downstream—they are not part of the sale of the factory's product, but they are harmed. This is a negative externality. The market price of the product does not include this social cost, so the factory may produce more than is socially desirable.\n\nPositive externalities also exist. Education, for example, benefits not only the person who receives it but also society through a more skilled workforce and lower crime. If individuals do not take these broader benefits into account, they may invest less in education than would be optimal for society as a whole.\n\nWhen externalities are significant, markets may fail to allocate resources efficiently. Governments often respond with taxes, subsidies, or regulations. A tax on pollution can make the producer bear part of the social cost; a subsidy for education can encourage more investment. Economists debate how much intervention is appropriate, but the concept of externalities helps explain why unregulated markets do not always lead to the best outcome for society.",

          "content": "A battery stores chemical energy and converts it into electrical energy when it is connected to a device. Inside a typical battery are two electrodes—a positive and a negative—and a substance called an electrolyte between them. When the battery is used, a chemical reaction occurs: electrons flow from the negative electrode through the external circuit to the positive electrode, while ions move through the electrolyte. This flow of electrons is the electric current that powers the device.\n\nWhen a rechargeable battery is charged, the reaction is reversed. Energy from an external source pushes electrons and ions back, restoring the chemical state of the battery so it can be used again. The amount of energy a battery can store depends on the materials used and the design. Over time, repeated charging and discharging can reduce a battery's capacity because the materials degrade.\n\nBatteries are used in everything from phones and laptops to electric vehicles and grid storage. Research continues into materials that can store more energy, last longer, and be made from more abundant or less harmful substances.",

          "topic": "Engineering",
          "content": "Electricity grids were designed for power that can be adjusted to match demand. Traditional power plants—coal, gas, nuclear—can increase or decrease output as needed. Wind and solar power, by contrast, depend on the weather. The sun does not shine at night; the wind does not always blow. This variability poses a challenge for grid operators who must keep supply and demand in balance at all times.\n\nTo integrate more renewable energy, grids need flexibility. One approach is to use energy storage, such as large batteries or pumped hydro, to store excess renewable power when supply is high and release it when supply is low. Another is to improve connections between regions so that surplus power in one area can be sent to another. Demand response—in which consumers reduce or shift their use when the grid is under stress—also helps.\n\nNo single solution is sufficient. Grids will likely combine storage, transmission, and demand management. The transition to higher shares of renewable energy also requires changes in market rules and planning, so that the system remains reliable and affordable as the mix of generation changes.",
