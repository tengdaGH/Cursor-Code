If you have to get to work or take kids to school, a car might be the only option. So I think governments should improve alternatives first before making driving harder or more expensive." }

With videos, everything is already shown to you, so you might not think as deeply. Reading also improves your vocabulary and writing." },
        { "author": "Skyler", "text": "Videos and films can be just as valuable. Documentaries can show you real places and events that are hard to describe in words. And a good film can make you feel and think about a topic in a powerful way. For some people, watching is easier than reading, so they might learn more from a video than from a book." }
