Consequentialist theories judge actions by their outcomes whereas deontological theories focus on duties and rules. Virtue ethics emphasizes the development of good character rather than the application of abstract principles. These frameworks sometimes yield different conclusions when applied to the same practical dilemma. Philosophers continue to debate whether one approach can be unified or whether pluralism is unavoidable.",
