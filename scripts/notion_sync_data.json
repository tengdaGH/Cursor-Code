We wanted to let you know about some exciting changes coming to the main dining hall. Starting next week, we will be introducing new vegetarian and vegan options at every meal. These options will be clearly labeled and available at a dedicated station. We have also expanded our salad bar to include more fresh vegetables and fruits. In response to student feedback, we are reducing the use of processed foods and focusing on fresh, locally sourced ingredients whenever possible. Additionally, we will be offering extended hours on weekdays, with the dining hall now open until 9 PM instead of 8 PM. We hope these changes will better serve our diverse student community. If you have any dietary concerns or suggestions, please speak with our dining services manager. Thank you.\n\n"
